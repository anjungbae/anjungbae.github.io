              <i>Abstract</i>: Although deliberative practice is essential for the legitimacy of institutions, increasing studies portray the U.S. Congress as an institution paralyzed by polarization, where members' speeches serve as partisan branding rather than deliberative exchange. This article challenges that deterministic view by advancing the concept of Shared Issue Attention (SIA)—the alignment of public signals weighted by topical relevance. Analyzing policy speeches in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1873 and 2010 (43rd–111th Congresses), we construct the congressional social network to uncover the structural patterns and mechanisms of legislative discourse formation. Our analysis yields two folds of critical insights. First, the structure of the congressional SIA network exhibits a small-world architecture--characterized as both high clustering and short distance--suggesting sustained efficiency in information transmission. Despite a modern rise in party assortativity, the network remains integrated through dominant cross-party triads, indicating that subcommunities are permeable rather than segregated by party boundaries. Second, the analysis of the causal speech diffusion revealed that social influence among members is robust, dynamic, and reciprocal. While the magnitude varies across Congresses, positive speech diffusion between members occurs almost without exception in the analyzed period. Contrary to the narrative of partisan echo chambers, inter-party and intra-party diffusion occur at nearly identical magnitudes in all Congresses. Furthermore, we observe significant minority-party influence, challenging theories of unilateral majority agenda control. These findings indicate that Congress operates on an incidental model of deliberation, retaining a resilient capacity for deliberative policy-making that persists beneath the surface of partisan conflict.

              "Informal Mediation: Shared Issue Attention and Bipartisan Coordination in the U.S. House of Representatives, 1873-2010."
            </summary>
            <div style="padding: 10px 20px; color: #555;">
              <i>Abstract</i>: For congressional mediation to function effectively, members must engage in social influence processes that facilitate inter-group coordination. We argue that members participate in these informal coordination processes through making public speeches on the congressional floor. Analyzing policy speeches in the House from the 43rd to 111th Congresses, we demonstrate that issue attention serves as an informal mechanism for promoting bipartisan coordination in legislative voting. Our analysis documents evidence contrary to pervasive skeptical views regarding congressional rhetoric. First, by measuring and modeling Shared Issue Attention (SIA), we confirm that SIA cannot be reduced to mere partisan rhetoric. Second, we find that SIA exerts a significant positive effect on legislative voting agreement (4.1 percentage points per 1 standard deviation increase in SIA, translating to approximately 48 additional vote coordinations per Congress). Crucially, this effect is more than twice as large between members of different parties, while it is marginal and unreliable among members of the same party. Subsequent analysis shows that the bipartisan coordination effect of SIA is particularly activated under the presence of party pressure, suggesting that SIA functions to counterbalance party pressure. These coordination effects are estimated using a doubly robust approach and dynamic identification, and inferred while modeling the error structure of dyadic data. This study reveals that floor speeches are not merely instruments for individual or partisan branding, but serve as effective informal channels for bipartisan coordination, highlighting the deliberative potential of Congress.
